        "Generators: Start producing values immediately. There's no initial delay for the entire sequence to be computed. This is beneficial when you only need a few items from a very long sequence.\n",

        "Generators: Values are computed only when they are needed. This is efficient when not all values in a sequence might be consumed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Handling Infinite Sequences:\n",
